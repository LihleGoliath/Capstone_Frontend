          Quote:
          '  The "First Great Debate" also known as the "Realist-Idealist Great Debate"[3] was a dispute between idealists and realists which took place in the 1930s and 1940s[4] and which was fundamentally about how to deal with Nazi Germany.[5] Realist scholars emphasized the anarchical nature of international politics and the need for state survival. Idealists emphasized the possibility of international institutions such as the League of Nations. However, some have argued that defining the debate between realism and idealism in terms of a great debate is a misleading caricature and so described the "great debate" as a myth.  '
